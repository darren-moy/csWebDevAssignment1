            My name is Darren Moy and I am a Junior at Hunter College studying computer science.
            I spend my free time mostly playing videos games like Counter-Strike 2 or Valorant. 
            During the winters, I try to go snowboarding as much as I can. 
            The image above is taken in Utah at Alta, a ski resort.
            I love traveling but have not had the chance nor the funds nor the time to travel to my 
            dream destinations, but one day I will. The only places worth mentioning so far that I've been to are: 
            China (Guang Zhou, Hong Kong), Canada (Toronto), San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Utah. I'd like to
            go to Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Quebec, Alaska, Iceland, Sweden, Paris and the list goes on.
