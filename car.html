            The BMW m3 f80 is an amazing car for its price. It's stock 0-60 time is 3.9 seconds and for a car
            produced between 2014 and 2018, that's pretty quick. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The f80 is offered with 2 transmissions: DCT(dual clutch transmission) or a 6-speed manual.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's also rear wheel drive, which means it's easy to do donuts in.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although the average cost for a f80 in good condition is around $60k, it is my most realistic dream car.

            Here's a video with a f80 doing a launch control. It looks slower than 3.9 seconds because the driver 
            is on a public road with an unprepped road surface(meaning the tires cannot hook instantly, you will
            hear some tire spin).
